This is a basic planning document for the Pizza Prefs project.

The MVP of the project should be able to do the following:
	*Store multiple people in a permanent file
		*This file/object should contain a name and a guid
		*It should also contain values indicating how well a topping is liked
	*Load people dynamically into a session
	*Compare their overlapping pizza topping preferences and return an ideal 	pizza


Name: Pepperoni
IsMeat: 

class cust
{
	Name
	order
	list<Ipreference> pref;
}
interface Ipreferences
{

}

topping
{
	topping(string name)
	{
		new x();
	}
}

perproni : Ipreference
{
	public pepproni(string ammont){ howmuch=ammount}
	IsMeadt=true;
	howmuch
}

cust cust1=new Cust().Preft.add(new peproni("less"));
cust1.pref.add(pepper)
